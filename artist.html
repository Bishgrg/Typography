            <h1>The Artist</h1>
                <p>
                    Kwon Hyuk (Hangul: 권혁; born November 10, 1992), better known by his stage name Dean, is a South Korean alternative R&B singer-songwriter, rapper and record producer. He has released one solo EP, 130 Mood: TRBL, as well as multiple collaborations with both American and South Korean artists. <br><br>

                    He began his career at the age of sixteen, performing with hip-hop artist Keith Ape. By eighteen, he was writing tracks for K-pop stars, under the name 'Deanfluenza'. The name originated from actor James Dean, whose rebellious image appealed to him, and the word 'influenza', signifying his desire to make a "viral" impact on the music industry.
