            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>Instagram is the new single by R&B and Pop artist DEΔN. It was released on December 26th, 2017.

                    The song sound features a slow melancholic guitar melody with slow beats throughout.
                    
                    Instagram is about the social media platform, as the title tells us, but has a deeper meaning, about sometimes feeling alone, depressed, and insecure within today’s digital age.<br><br>
                    
                    In an interview with 1theK , DEΔN explains the inspiration for the song by saying, “The thing is, I often feel depressed when I got on Instagram. I follow people that I look up to and people that I like, compared to those people I feel infinitely small and lacking”
                    
                    In the same interview, he describes the song as, “A song that gives out the vibe of ‘Robinson Crusoe’ living in the city”<br><br>

                    Due to the rather depressing and personal nature of the song. After much attempts with other fonts, I decided to settle on a handwritten font to make it feel as personal as possible. It truly is a song that when you hear it makes you relaxed and the melody is very catchy, yet the lyrics are very unnervingly relateable and revealing of the troubles/dangers of social media.
